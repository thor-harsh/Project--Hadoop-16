**In this project We will use Spark with Python to do a great stuff. Here We will upgrade our previous WordCount project. We will add the normalize function to handle UTF encoding properly using our amazing spark to make an easy analysis of project along with giving us the correct result**.<br></br>

**Before jumping to the code lets understand Spark first**...<br></br>

Apache Spark is an open-source unified analytics engine for large-scale data processing. Spark provides an interface for programming clusters with implicit data parallelism and fault tolerance.<br></br>


**Important Note: Go through the Book Text before jumping to the code.**
