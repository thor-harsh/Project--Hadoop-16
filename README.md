**In this project We will use Spark with Python to do a great stuff. Here We will upgrade our previous WordCount project. We will add the normalize function to handle UTF encoding properly using spark which was not in previous project**.<br></br>

**Before jumping to the code lets understand Spark first**...<br></br>

**What is Apache Spark**?<br></br>

Apache Spark is a multi-language engine for executing data engineering, data science, and machine learning on single-node machines or clusters.
Apache Spark is an open-source unified analytics engine for large-scale data processing. Spark provides an interface for programming clusters with implicit data parallelism and fault tolerance.<br></br>


**Important Note: Go through the Book Text before jumping to the code.**

**So what are you waiting for...? Jump to the code to get started. As usual for any doubt or query see you in pull request section 😁😂. Thanks!**
